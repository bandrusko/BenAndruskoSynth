                    <p class="TextBack">The aesthetic of synthwave was first developed in the music scene as
                        a form of nostalgia, paying homage to the 1980's and 1990's. These designs usually
                        contain grid-like lines, sunsets and city skylines to emulate a dystopian-type world.

                    <p class="TextBack">The aesthetic mainly comes from video games and movies that were
                        made between the 1980's and 1990's. Synthwave was a form of nostalgic representation
                        of these classic sci-fi games and movies, such as the original Tron movie for example.

                        in art, so I tried to emulate that through the use of 3D in my map. The 3D used in my
                        map would try emulate the city skylines over the setting sun, in which 3D was useful
                        for that mapping aspect.

                        design of the map. I had also used blurring and emissions to make the 2D portions, such as
                        walking paths and roads, to make it stand out amongst the towering 3D parts.

                        mainly found these fonts through video game covers of the time. I had used a series of 
                        Orbitron fonts for a variety of features such as neighborhoods, rivers, and small cities.

                        incorporating both the sunset and night sky aspect within modern
                        synthwave artwork. Within cities I try to use different colors for different features, 
                        such as roads, sidewalks and rail lines. This tried to emulate the grid-like design
                        typically incorportated into synthwave artwork.

                        and emulate a synthwave artpiece.

                        on the three-dimensional buildings. This texture came from the sun from the synthwave artwork at the start.
                        I had deliberated a lot on different
                        textures, from grids to building lights. I figured the best texture that
                        blended well with a setting sun atmosphere was the sun itself, as it looks as if the buildings are reflecting 
                        the colors off of its glass. I had dimmed
                        the overall color of the map with an overarching dark blue hue, which made
                        the texture of the bright setting sun on the buildings distinguish itself
                        from the other colors, on top of blending with the rest of the colors.

                        mixing with the base purple color while also trying to implement the pattern
                        subtly within the mountains since mountains are angular. In some areas I noticed that
                        national parks tended to have elevated places. When mixing it with mountainous cities,
                        such as Vancouver or Rio de Janeiro, it really brings aesthetic come to life.

                            <p class="no-margin">There were plenty of cities to choose from in Europe. With its vast train network, city-grid design and
                                plenty of walking paths, European cities are known to be some of the best for modern transportaion.</p>

                            <p class="no-margin">The difficulty when it came to finding a city that best fits the synthwave aesthetic was the lack of
                                highrise buildings within a city's central business district. Since European cities are so old, they tend to preserve
                                a lot of historical sites.</p>

                            <p class="no-margin">So why choose Milan to represent synthwave? A few reasons. While looking from a geographic perspective,
                                Milan was close to a mountain range that provided the ideal aesthetic.</p>

                            <p class="no-margin">Milan also had a lot of walking paths, a great infrastructure network and lots of greenspace. All of
                                these aspects together create a diverse mix which brings out the best in the synthwave aesthetic.</p>

                            <p class="no-margin">Finally, Milan has one of the most modern skylines in Europe. With the city having one of the tallest
                                buildings all across the continent, it adds to the dystopian nature that synthwave brings.</p>
